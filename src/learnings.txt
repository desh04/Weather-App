1. "inherit" keyword  :  The inherit keyword specifies that a property should inherit its value from its parent element.
                      The inherit keyword can be used for any CSS property, and on any HTML element.
          eg: span {
                color: blue;
              }
              .extra span {
                 color: inherit;
              } // color will be blue(inderiting from the parent span)


2. Pseudo-element : A CSS pseudo-elemeny is a keyword added to a selector that let us style a specific part of the element.
        eg: "::first-line" let us change the style of first line. used like below- 
        Syntex  p::first-line { //CSS code;}
    Note: As a rule, double colons (::) should be used instead of a single colon (:). This distinguishes pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements.
    other Pseudo-elements --
    ::after (:after)
    ::before (:before)
    ::backdrop
    ::first-letter (:first-letter)
    ::first-line (:first-line)
    ::file-selector-button

etc..

3. z - index :  The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
                An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
                Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).
                Note: If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top.
        syntex : z-index: auto|number|initial|inherit;
